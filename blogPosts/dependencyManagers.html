Bower
- It is just downloading github repositories and support update operation.
We still have to manage the loading inside our application 
manually which means choosing AMD or CommonJS.
To support Bower downloading we just need component.json inside application root.
Some of the libraries are addpated in github repo called Components 

Component
- It specifies a component as a set of js and css that will be very granular.
So if we register a piece of code as a component we could require it in CommonJS style inside our application.
Note that libraries must have a specific rewriting in order to support component concept
