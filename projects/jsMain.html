							My desire to learn JavaScript in depth dates back to 2007.
							Unfortunately for one reason or another I did not have the time to do it until 2012. 
							Back in 2011 I wrote <a href="http://pltod.github.com/c1WhyJS.html">why I would like to spend time on JavaScript</a>. 
							And now my focus is fully on learning it. I hope that this delay is for good. 
							Now I see an ecosystem around JavaScript that is really impressive and more importantly 
							stable. However the availability of so many new technologies, libraries, frameworks, and 
							standards hinders the learning process.							
							<br/><br/>
							I know that there are many books out there that cover the JavaScript language, or particular library or framework. 
							But I wanted to have something like a map that is more oriented towards the development process. 
							For example, I needed to know which technology, framework, aspect, or technique fits where in the development process, 
							or in which part of a layered software architecture.
							<br/><br/>
							So I allowed myself to create a sample content (categories or chapters if you want) that will help me organize my knowledge. 
							There are a lot better resources on the web about this kind of stuff. But I am using this classification since it fits well my needs. 
							Each category has a summary with short explanation what it is all about and links to resources that 
							I found most useful for understanding particular topic. During the time I am going to add detailed blog 
							posts associated with one of these categories. Some of these posts will have presentation slides as well. 
							These blog posts are often heavily influenced by materials on the web or sometimes evolved as a result of my practice.							<br/><br/>
							As you can see this is a work in progress. However, my wish is to cover most of the things in a period of 1 year. 
							So I plan to update this content very often. 
							<br/><br/>
							If you like you could <a href="http://twitter.com/pltod">follow me on twitter</a> to get notifications for the latest updates.

							<h2>Chapter 1. EcmaScript Core Theory</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="well">
							Usually most of us (at least me) prefer to work with technologies that give us immediate feedback of what we are doing. 
							JavaScript is such technology – we do something and see results. 
							Moreover, we could take a library or two and make some things on the web that are pretty impressive without having much knowledge about the language.
							<br/><br/>
							However I think that the fun is much more when one knows the specifics. 
							Learning EcmaScript (the standard which JavaScript language implements) core theory is not that easy. 
							But if you are lucky enough you will find out  <a target=”_blank” href='http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/'> the blog of Dmitry Soshnikov</a> and the things will start changing. 
							He explains the most important things in EcmaScript version 3 and version 5 of the standard in an amazingly understandable way. 
							of the standard.
						</div> 
							If we decide to learn core theory we must learn about things like:						
						<ul>
							<li>context theory</li>
							<li>context lifecycle vs. function lifecycle</li>
							<li>identifiers vs. properties </li>
							<li>hoisting </li>
							<li>dynamic scopes </li>
							<li>function creation algorithm </li>
							<li>closures </li>
							<li>prototype chain </li>
							<li>function declaration vs. function expression </li>
						</ul>
						<div class="well">
							My JavaScript language insights came after I have read his posts as well as 
							some other nice posts by <a target= "_blank" href="http://kangax.github.com/">Juriy Zaytsev</a> 
							and <a target= "_blank" href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/">Angus Croll</a> 
							So my purpose is not to rewrite the explanation of all these concepts from scratch.
							<br/><br/>
							Instead I have prepared a presentation, included some more materials, structured the flow a little bit differently, and added 
							some tweaks from my perspective.<a target= "_blank" href="http://pltod.github.com/c2CoreTheory.html"> In this presentation </a> 
							(and this is also valid for all my presentations and blog posts) I am trying to not be so scientific. I don’t know is this a good approach but 
							I am trying to post things that could be understood even by non-programmers. I am trying to simplify the stuff and to not use more than one 
							term for the same thing. So I have wrapped the presentation of the core theory concepts in a CRUD framework. With other words the presentation 
							flow is based on create, read, update and delete operations. If I am not wrong the programming languages are kind of in-memory CRUD operations 
							so presenting terms along with each operation sounds natural to me.
							<br/><br/>
							Finally I would like to mention that I see some concepts like history of EcmaScript and 
							EcmaScript versions, JavaScript Engines and JavaScript Dialects as prerequisites for learning JavaScript Core Theory.

							The software and the way we build it heavily depend on what the business needs.  
							So if you need to understand why we build software in particular manner, just try to understand what are business needs. 
							In the context of web based applications (including mobile applications) the organizations want more and more 
							desktop-like software with very intuitive and dynamic user interfaces and huge reactivity. 
							Sometimes responsive features are a must in order to be able to deliver mobile solutions with fewer costs.
							<br/><br/>
							You can read the two articles by Paul Hammant 
							which summarize very well <a href="http://paulhammant.com/2012/02/06/previous-web-architectures/"> the history of web application architectures</a> 
							and <a href="http://paulhammant.com/2012/02/06/webapp-model-quandary/">the current trends in web application architectures</a>.
							<br/><br/>
							The consequences for the web application developer are that he must deal with a huge amount of client-side code.
							And all kind of questions arise. But the most important is: 
							How to organize the huge amount of client side code in a more structured way?  
							And the answer is...<a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvcmvp">MV* family of patterns</a>.
							<br/><br/>
							The community responded immediately with a huge amount of client-side libraries and frameworks. They strive to help us apply best practices out of the box. 
							<a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/">Have a journey through the jungle of these libraries and frameworks</a> 
							and <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/">read a nice classification and 
							comparison between the most popular of them</a>. If you need to be aware about the available libraries and frameworks and have a hands
